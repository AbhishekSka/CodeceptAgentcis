          <p>Last Updated : August 8 , &nbsp;2017</p>
          <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions (“Terms”, “Terms and Conditions”) carefully before using the <a href="https://www.agentcis.com">www.agentcis.com</a> website (the “Service”) operated by IntroCept Pty Ltd (“us”, “we”, or “our”).</p>
          <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service. You warrant that you are at least 18-years-old and you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts. If you are under 18-years-old, you warrant that you have obtained consent from your parent or guardian and they agree to be bound by these Terms on your behalf.</p>

          <p><b>Subscriptions</b></p>
          <p>Most parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set on an annual basis. Charges will depend on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
          <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or IntroCept Pty Ltd cancels it. Cancellation of subscription should be notified to us before subscription ends. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting IntroCept Pty Ltd customer support team.

By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize IntroCept Pty Ltd to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
          <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, IntroCept Pty Ltd will charge your registered Credit Card after 3 days of the initial failure. This process will continue for 9 days total, where IntroCept Pty Ltd will try to charge your registered Credit Card for a total of 3 times in 3 day intervals. If automatic billing still fails to occur, IntroCept Pty Ltd will cancel your subscription. You may resume Subscription once all financial dues have been cleared.</p>
          <p><b>Fee Changes</b></p>
          <p>IntroCept Pty Ltd, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription Fees (and/or) Plan for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription Fee (and/or) Plan change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
          <p>IntroCept Pty Ltd will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription Fees (and/or) Plan to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>

          <p><b>Refunds</b></p>
